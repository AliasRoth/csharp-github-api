It uses the [RestSharp][3] [REST client][2] library for most of the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nThis library is not an official Github product, is not supported or developed by Github, and all Github trademarks are their own.\r\n\r\nTargets .NET 4.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nBarely does anything at the moment. I'm lazy. Started working on this off and on again. Send a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nContributions in the form of pull requests are welcome :)\r\n\r\n### Running the tests\r\nIn order to successfully run the integration tests which require an authenticated connection to github (i.e. quite a few of them), you will need to create a file called csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests.dll.config, in the csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests\r\nfolder. Simply use the provided example as a starting point:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cp csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests/csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests.dll.config.example csharp-github-api.IntegrationTests/csharp-github-api.Integration\r\nTests.dll.config\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust add your Github username and password. The file is in .gitignore, so you can't accidently commit it.\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n  <appSettings>\r\n    <add key=\"username\" value=\"example\"/>\r\n    <add key=\"password\" value=\"password\"/>\r\n    <add key=\"token\" value=\"abcedfg\"/>\r\n  </appSettings>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, details included in the source.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://temporalcohesion.co.uk\r\n  [2]: http://github.com/johnsheehan/RestSharp\r\n  [3]: http://restsharp.org/\r\n  [4]: http://developer.github.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
